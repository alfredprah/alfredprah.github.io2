As a Data Science Master’s student at Vanderbilt University, I have had an extensive range of experiences including selecting features, optimizing classifiers, mining data, expanding data by incorporating third-party sources, data exploration and processing, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and doing ad-hoc analyses. <br><br>

As a pre-requisite for enrollment in the Data Science Master’s program at Vanderbilt, I was required to have excellent communication skills, a solid understanding of algorithms, excellence in applied statistics, and a working knowledge of the Data Science toolkit. It is worth mentioning that my Data Science expertise spans many years: During my undergraduate education, I was able to apply both my domain knowledge and skillset during an Independent Marketing Research on *Psychographics and Emotional Motivators in relation to Consumer Behavior*, and used the findings of the research to revise
the business plan and Investor Proposal Letters of an online clothing business I started in 2014.<br><br>

I would like to thank you for taking the time to learn about my background and experiences. I am always happy to hop on a call to discuss anything Data Science related. You can reach me through my email: alfred.j.prah@vanderbilt.edu
